Retrospective
-------------

### Goods!
* Participation was more fluently than previous dojo's
* New programmers joined
* Improvements on understanding the TDD dynamic (with Uncle Bob help)
* Good discussion around TDD and algorithms terminology

### Bads :(
* 
* It's necessary a more detailed problem description (loss time on understanding)
* Cookies :(

### TODOs
* Find a problem more suitable for TDD 
* All participants propose a problem to moderator and he/she selects one
